# What this blog is about?
A combination of thoughts on technology-driven business, open source, engineering management. Posts may vary from purely abstract thoughts to  hands-on hacks.

# Who am I?
Someone who still gets time to code and thinks that the current technology bubble is something to be excited about. The present is an amazing time to change the way we book a room, hire a cab, watch a movie. The advance in current tools and stacks helps other businesses get on the same level with the likes of Amazon, Uber, Twitter and Airbnb. I'm in charge of Software Engineering at [Opentrons](https://opentrons.com) where we make robots for biologists! 

My past: [DataArt](http://dataart.com) and [DeviceHive](http://devicehive.com).

All opinions expressed in this blog are my own.
