# What this blog is about?
A combination of thoughts on technology-driven business, open source, scalability, data, platforms, internet of things and what you can do with it. Posts may vary from purely abstract thoughts to very hands-on hacks.

# Who am I?
Someone who still codes and thinks that the current technology bubble is something to be excited about. The present is an amazing time to change the way we book a room, hire a cab, watch a movie. The advance in current tools and stacks helps other businesses get on the same level with the likes of Amazon, Uber, Twitter and Airbnb. I'm in charge of innovation at DataArt, a technology consulting business, and the co-founder of DeviceHive, an IoT data platform

All opinions expressed in this blog are my own.
