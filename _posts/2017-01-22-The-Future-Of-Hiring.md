They are all using [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) as a sourcing platform for engineering talent. 

My prediction is that using platforms like Hackerrank will define the way we discover best engineering talent for years to come. 

No more sad job postings. Welcome to the world where engineers can solve problems to become better at what they are doing and get hired by companies who value and appreciate that.

Onwards and upwards! Software is eating the world.
